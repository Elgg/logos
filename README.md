Elgg official logos
===========

Logos
---------

These are the preferred versions of the Elgg and “E” Logos for 
use with the open source software and Elgg Community, with 
grey lettering and a blue dot. A white background will provide the 
best reproduction. Other colours and imagery can be used as a 
background only if there is sufficient contrast between the 
colour/image and the logo.

Guideline Colours: BLUE C 70 M 12 Y 0 K 0, GREY C 0 M 0 Y 0 K 70

Documents and Web pages representing these logos MUST include the statement: "Elgg" and the Elgg logo
are registered trademarks of Curverider Limited.

Word marks
------------

Elgg should be represented as “Elgg” with a capital “E”.

TODOs
